Extend your campus application to include classes and sections. A class has the following attributes.

    Prefix (e.g.: CS, MTH, …)
    Number (e.g.: 3710, …)
    Description

A section has the following attributes.

    Year
    Semester (Spring, Summer, Fall)

A class has many sections and a section belongs to a class. Create check boxes to select a section when creating/editing a class, and a drop-down for classes when creating/editing a section.

Add global navigation to all index pages. This can be as simple as having a table with link_to's to the appropriate "Prefix"s from "rails routes".

Make sure all the "Show"s also display the "other"; i.e.: a class's page should show all of its sections, and a section page should display the associated class.
